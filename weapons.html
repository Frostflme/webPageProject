            termonology.

        <h2>Common <a href="weapons/termonolgy.html">Termonology</a></h2>

            <p>
                <strong>Classes</strong>: What category of weapons a specific main weapon falls into.
            </p>
            <p>
                Someone's <strong>'Main'</strong> <em>(Not to be confused by main weapons)</em>: Someone's signature weapon; what someone plays often
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Slayer</strong>: A weapon that's suited better to playing aggressive and splatting the opposing team.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Skirmisher</strong>: Skirmishers are most useful for controlling areas or forcing advantageous fights.
            </p> 
            <p>
                <strong>Support</strong>: A weapon that's suited better to hanging back and painting for special or playing the objective.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Anchor</strong>: A weapon that's suited better to staying at a distance and holding the team together.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>(Tip: If any of this confuses you, try going to the original page for a more in-depth explanation!)</em>
            </p>
        <h2><a href="weapons/mainWeapons.html">Main Weapons</a></h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Shooters</strong>: The most versatile class, if you pick the right shooter, it can do really whatever you want it to.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Blasters</strong>: Used to be considered a shooter sub-class, they have slow shots that are strong and explode in a specific radius.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Rollers</strong>: A beginner-friendly class, they rely on either being stealthy or applying pressure from a distance.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Brushes</strong>: A movement-oriented class, the brushes can move quickly across the map, and they excel at countering slow weapons.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Chargers</strong>: A pressuring class, chargers apply a crazy amount of pressure with their one-shots on a full charge*.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Sloshers</strong>: A wild-card class, they can hit over walls, but all of them work differently.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Splatlings</strong>: Another pressuring class, splatlings charge then fire many shots very quickly.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Dualies</strong>: A movement-oriented class, dualies can do dodge rolls and evade attacks from others.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Brellas</strong>: A defensive class, brellas have a shield to block incoming fire**, and their attacks have a shotgun-like spread.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Splatanas</strong>: A hyper-aggressive class, the splatanas can one-shot in melee, and they have longer ranged options too.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Stringers</strong>: My personal favorite, stringers can pressure opponents over walls, and they can one-shot if you hit all three pellets.
            </p>
            <p><em>*not all chargers can one-shot on a full charge</em></p>
            <p><em>**as of version 1.2.0, brella's sheilds don't work properly</em></p>
        <h2><a href="weapons/subWeapons.html">Sub Weapons</a></h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Bombs</strong>: Being versatile options, bombs have a variety of uses from getting away to disrupting anchors.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Utility Subs</strong>: Often useful for a few specific purposes, they can be useful on the right weapons but aren't as versatile as bombs.
            </p>
        <h2><a href="weapons/specialWeapons.html">Special Weapons</a></h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Aggressive Specials</strong>: Special weapons that are often most useful to splat the opponents, often most useful on slayer weapons.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Supportive Specials</strong>: Supportive specials are used for protecting areas, controlling space, or otherwise helping the team.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Displacement Specials</strong>: Displacement specials are used to force people to move, distracting them or forcing them out of an area.
